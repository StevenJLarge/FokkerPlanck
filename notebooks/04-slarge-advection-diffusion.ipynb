    "# FPE - Advection-diffusion equation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we go over the combination of both the advection and diffusion components of the Fokker-Planck equation together and benchmark the results against the expected physical quantities in a harmonic trap\n",
    "\n",
    "From a mathematical point of view, we are now solving the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\partial_t p(x, t) = -\\beta D \\partial_x [F(x, t) p(x, t)] + D\\partial_{x}^2 p(x, t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F(x, t)$ is the (generally) time- and space-dependant force. In this notebook, instead of the constant force scenario (arising from a linear potential energy function) we look at a (time-independent) harmonic confining potential of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E(x) = \\frac{k}{2}(x - \\lambda)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the equilibrium distribution is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\pi(x | \\lambda) \\propto e^{-\\beta E(x)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and is therefore a Gaussian, with mean $\\lambda$ and variance $1 / \\beta k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in this scenario, if the initial state is a Gaussian distribution, then under the time-dependant dynamics, the distribution will stay Gaussian. Quantitatively, the mean will evolve as\n",

    "$$ \\langle x \\rangle = \\lambda - \\langle x_0\\rangle e^{-\\beta D t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, for this system, when the minimum of the harmonic potential is translated at a constant velocity, the work and power supplied are known exactly. For a system that begins at equilibrium with the stationary harmonic potential, if the position of the base $\\lambda$ then begins translating forward at a velocity of $\\dot{\\lambda}$, the excess work and excess power are given by\n",

    "In this notebook, we will show how the combined advection and diffusion logic combine to realistically replicate these desired physical properties.\n",
